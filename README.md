# FADA_on_offfice-home
pytorch 1.0 implementation on Few-shot adversarial domain adaptation[1] on office-home[2] dataset

## about
This repository is unofficial implementation of Few-shot adversarial domain adaptation[1] on office-home dataset.   
Though [1] treats digit recognition task and office dataset task, we applied the algorythm to office-home dataset which has more number of classes.  

## usage
run   
```
mkdir dataset
mkdir result
mkdir csv
bash script.sh

```
